        =======
        
        
        To get data from a Learning Registry Lite node, you issue an HTTP GET request to the /v1/lr endpoint
        
        ``` Shell
        curl http://domain/v1/lr
        ```
        
        This will return JSON 
        
        
        ``` JSON
        {
            "response":[...]
        }
        ```
        
        This request can be augmented with the following query string paramaters
        
        paramater | type | effect
        ----------|-------|--------
        include_docs | boolean | true: entire envelope false: only IDs
        from | ISO8601 Timestamp | Earliest node_timestamp returned
        until | ISO8601 Timestamp | Latest node_timestamp returned
        page | Integer | results page, starting at 0
        
        To submit data submit a PUT request to the /v1/lr endpoint 
        
        ``` Shell
        curl -XPOST http://domain/v1/lr -H "Content-Type: applicaiton/json" -d @envelope.json -u username
        ```
        
        
        Submission uses HTTP Basic Auth and requires a user account to be able to publish
        
        You can signup for an account on the node by going to 
        
        ```
        http://domain/signup
        ```
        and filling in the form for an account.
